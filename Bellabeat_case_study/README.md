# Bellabeat Case Study

## Project Overview
This example data analyst project is provided as a capstone project in the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera.  

**Summary:** You are a data analyst working for the company Bellabeat that manufacturs high-tech, health-centric products. You have been tasked to use data collected from one of their health products that tracks activity, sleep, and stress. You are assigned with analyzing the data and identifying any insights on how customers are using said product.  

A standard roadmap for a data analyst consists of the following: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Anazlye, Share, and Act.** This readme will serve as a detailed journal documenting the thought process behind how I accomplished each part of the given capstone project.

## Case Study Roadmap

### Ask
The purpose of **Ask** is for the data analyst to formulate outline the key components of the task, including the business goal, key stakeholders, identifying data sources, collecting relevant data, transforming data, analyzing data, preparing results, and presenting insights and/or strategies.  

When asking questions regarding the scope of the project, it is important to keep in mind the overarching business goal being addressed:
- **The overall goal is to use health-related data collected from health-tracking devices to gain insight into how customers use these devices**
- **The insights drawn from the data are to be used to inform business strategy, such as marketing and advertising efforts by Bellabeat**

#### Major objectives during the Ask phase
1. Identify the business task
2. Consider key stakeholders

**The overall business task is to provide recommendations for business strategy using health tracker data collected from customers.**  
  - Consider the objectives of customers who use these products. This can inform an analyst on what trends to examine and contextualize findings
    - People interested in these products use them to try and improve their health
    - Professionals may use them to track training
    - Not everyone will use all functions available (some may these for activity tracking, others exclusively for sleep, etc.)

**For this project, it is made aware that the findings will be presented to the following individuals:**
- Urška Sršen: Chief Creative Officer 
- Sando Mur: Mathematician and cofounder
- Marketing analytics team: Your team

Knowing your audience is important for formulating presentations of results. Because we're presenting to executives, our focus should primarily be on the insights and actions with less focus on minutia. Because Sando Mur has a mathematical background and we're presenting to our own team, highlighting specific analytical steps such as what analyses were done should be considered. If necessary, the inclusion of more granular information regarding data processing and how analyses were conducted can be included in the appendix.
